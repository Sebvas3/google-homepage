This is my first ever project. 
I'm full of insecurities, full of doubts.
I really don't think that I can reach my goals in this attempt of change my life.
I really hate my work and I don't think that it will be a work to do for the rest of my life. 
Hope that I can reach my dreams and finally start to do something that I really enjoy.
